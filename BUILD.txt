BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================

The Makefile (in the src folder) is intended to be used by Microsoft NMAKE 
tool, which comes with Visual C++ 6. You will need the following 3rd-party
software to build this program:

- DirectX 8.1 SDK

Modify the setenv.cmd so that it sets correct paths.

To build:
Open a command prompt window, and run "setenv.cmd" to set up the environment.

Two types of build are supported by the current Makefile: 
"debug" and "release"

To do a "debug" build, just type "nmake".
To do a "release" build, type "nmake release".

(NOTE: You can also build the EXE and DLL files separately, using 
appropriate targets, specified in the Makefile.)
