LOD Mixer Module for Kitserver 4                                December 2,2022
=============================================================================
Version 4.5.0 


1. SUPPORTED GAME VERSIONS
--------------------------
PC: PES4 1.0, PES4 1.10, WE8I (US & Korea)

2. INTRODUCTION
---------------
This is a version of LOD Mixer that works together with Kitserver, as the
run-time module. Unlike the original LOD Mixer, this module does NOT modify
your EXE file, but instead makes the changes at run-time in memory - the
same way as Kitserver works. 

This tool is just for Level-of-Detail adjustment for player and
goalkeeper models.


3. THE IDEA OF LOD
------------------
This is by no means a formal definition of Level-of-Detail (LOD) idea, but
merely a short introduction to the concept, which will hopefully be helpful 
in understanding what the LOD Mixer program does, and how to use it.
Typically (and PES4/WE8 are no exception), a rendering engine in 3D games is
designed to take advantage of the fact that objects that look small need
simpler models than objects that look big. A close-up view of a car may
require thousands of polygons to look convincing, but may only need a few
hundred when the distance between it and the camera is big and the amount
of pixels it occupies on the screen is small. By using simpler models for 
far-away objects, the game engine saves GPU cycles that could be used for
creating additional visual effects, or just to maintaining a smooth frame
rate. Level-Of-Detail algorithm is the logic that decides when to use
a particular model for a particular object. 

For the task of rendering players and goalkeepers, PES4 and WE8I/K use 5 
different levels of detail, which are dynamically switched depending on 
a set of factors: distance from camera to player, playing mode, active 
player, etc.

#1: Very high-detail models, big (512x256) textures",
#2: High-detail models, medium (256x128) textures",
#3: Medium-detail models, medium (256x128) textures",
#4: Low-detail models, small (128x64) textures",
#5: Very low-detail models, small (128x64) textures",

LOD #1 is used for cut-scenes and more in replays than in actual game. It's
the only one that uses best quality kit textures - 512x256. LOD #2 and #3
are typically used for many cameras, including "Normal Long" and "Wide". 
LOD #2 is also used for some cut-scenes - like pre-match photos, for example,
and also in replays. LOD #4 - on "Wide" and "Bird's Eye", and LOD #5 i was 
only able to see with "Bird's-Eye" cameras.

To illustrate the concept, consider this scenario:
The camera is really close to the player, so the game engine selects LOD #1
to show the very well detailed model of the player with nice-looking textures
As the player moves away from the camera, at some point the game engine 
decides that the very high level of detail is not needed anymore, and it 
should be switched to next one - LOD #2, since the camera is now 
far enough and the user won't notice the difference. Here's where the problem
occurs with PES4 and WE8I/K: we actually DO see the 
difference, because KONAMI implemented a very aggressive LOD algorithm and it 
switches to lower-detail models way too early, and that's why we see annoying 
artifacts, as player balding and low-quality kit textures. I can only guess 
why they did it, and i think it's because the lowest denominator system 
- PS2 - couldn't sustain the smooth frame rate with a more concervative 
LOD switching algorithm.
