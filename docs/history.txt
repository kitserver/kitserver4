KitServer CHANGE LOG                                        October 30, 2018
============================================================================

4.4.1
-----
- tweaked setup.exe and kserv DLL loading logic to work the same way
as later kitservers work (for PES5 and PES6, for example). This allows
kitserver to load correctly on modern Windows systems

4.4.0
-----
- support for fullscreen and internal resolution

4.3.11
------
- added explicit aspect-ratio setting (in kserv.cfg)
- game speed control option (in kserv.cfg)

4.3.10
------
- support for compressed WE8.exe
- fixed bug when GK kit wasn't always loading in PES4 Demo, Demo2

4.3.9
-----
- fixed ball selector bug, which was introduced in 4.3.8 release.

4.3.8
-----
Mostly a bug-fix release, but some small new features included as well.
- fixed the "handless-keeper" bug.
- fixed the problems when kit model/collar/collars were not correctly set
in edit mode or after using "Play again with different teams" option.
- kitserver now recognizes edited kits (altered in Edit Mode) and treats
them properly - that is: not trying to do anything with them.

New feature: goalkeeper gloves in BMP format ("gloves.bmp").
New feature: support for alpha channel for colors (You can now specify
transparent or semi-transparent colors for name/number on shirt/shorts)
New feature: additonal attributes to specify on per-kit basis:
- the cuff-type for shirts
- location of number on shorts (off, left, right, both)
- number type (0-4)
- name type (0-1)
- name shape (straignt, curved)

4.3.2
-----
Bug-fix release.
- Kitserver doesn't cause the game crash anymore, if an "Original" ML team 
is used in Master League Mode (or Exhibition Mode).
- Team identification algorithm reworked. Now more simple and stable.

4.3.1
-----
New hot-key: for going backwards in extra balls list.
Bug-fix: balls with BMP-textures are now properly rendered at all times
(before, it is was only rendered correctly for one match, and messed up in
the next match)

4.3.0
-----
Added support for WE8:I PC.
New feature: ball selector
- Fixed a bug in ML vs. ML exhibition game, when extra kit selection was 
getting confused and mixing up the teams.

4.2.1
-----
- Fixed the problem with pressing Alt-Tab (context switching). The game
doesn't crash anymore when you temporarily switch to some other application,
and then go back to PES4.

4.2.0
-----
Main new feature: support for "3rd" (extra) kits.
Players and goalkeepers can have unlimited number of extra kits configured.
Also, for "default" and "3rd" kits, the following is now possible:
- set colors (shirt name, number, shorts number)
- set collar (yes/no)
- set shirt 3D-model
Change in setup.exe: manual selection of OS is disabled by default.
To enable, use "-os" command-line parameter.

4.1.7
-----
- Better error diagnostics and logging.

4.1.6
-----
- Texture boost re-implemented using slightly different method.
- Problems with kits in Training mode (a.k.a. "Regulate Condition") fixed.

4.1.5
-----
Bug-fixing release.
- Kits from KDB now work correctly for the P1 Master League team.
- Texture boost can now also be applied to non-KDB kits (from AFS). 
The configuration parameter: "kit.useLargeTexture" now takes 3 diff. values:
0 - no boost, 1 - only KDB kits boosted, 2 - all kits boosted.
- Fixed a bug when sometimes (at random moments) a kit from KDB wouldn't 
replace AFS kit, even though it should have.
- Kitserver's setup.exe now offers a manual selection for operating system.
Auto-detect mode is still available, and should work fine in 99.9% of cases.
However, if you experience a problem with early game crash, try the
manual selection. (Explained in more details in REAMDE.txt).

4.1.4
-----
"Texture boost" feature introduced.
When this feature is enabled (which it is by default), the KitServer forces
the game to use larger kit texture for near and medium distance from camera
to the player. This fixes the problem, observed by many, that kits from KDB
looked good only when camera was very close to the player.

Early testing showed no performance hit, when using texture boost. But, 
if you notice that your game runs slower with this feature enabled, or you
simply don't like how the kits look, you can turn texture boost off:
Open kserv.cfg file (it's just a text file: you can use Notepad, or any 
text editor), change "kit.useLargeTexture" value to 0, and restart the
game.

4.1.1
-----
First public version that actually works with demo (70MB, 200MB)
and the full game (1.0, 1.10)
